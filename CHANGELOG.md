# Changelog

This document outlines the changes and improvements made on top of the original Insect Detect project by Sittinger et al. over the last three months. Our modifications extend the functionality and usability of the automated insect monitoring system, all shared under the same GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) for open collaboration.

## Recent Updates - 2024 Q1

### Added
- **Cellular Connection for Wireless Data Transmission:** Implemented cellular connectivity to enable remote transmission of data and images, enhancing the device's applicability in field research without relying on traditional Wi-Fi networks.
- **GPIO Pin LED Control:** Integrated GPIO pin control for UV and White light LEDs.
- **Main Script Consolidation:** Developed a main script file (`main.py`) to consolidate the initiation and coordination of all system functions, simplifying the startup process and enhancing system manageability.
- **Refactoring for Customizability and Clarity:** Undertook a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase to improve customization options for users and enhance overall code understanding.

### Changed
- **User Customization Features:** Enhanced user customization options, allowing for more flexible configuration of camera settings, data logging intervals, and LED behavior based on specific research needs or environmental conditions.

### Compliance and Attribution
- This project builds upon and extends the original work titled "Insect Detect: An open-source DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring" by Sittinger et al., adhering to the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3).
- Our modifications are intended to contribute to the open-source community, encouraging further development, collaboration, and sharing in the spirit of the original project.

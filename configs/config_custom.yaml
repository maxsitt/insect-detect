# Use this custom config file for modifications (copy and create multiple configurations if needed)

# Deployment metadata (use web app for editing - Geolocation API requires 'webapp.https' enabled)
deployment:
  start:        # Start date + time of the camera deployment (ISO 8601 format)
  location:
    latitude:   # Latitude (decimal degrees)
    longitude:  # Longitude (decimal degrees)

  notes:        # Additional fieldnotes

# Camera settings
camera:
  fps: 20                # Camera frame rate (range: 1-30) -> higher fps increases power consumption

        min: 154         # Minimum lens position (range: 0-255) - greater distance to camera
        max: 165         # Maximum lens position (range: 0-255) - shorter distance to camera
  isp:
    sharpness: 1         # Image sharpness (range: 0-4) - setting to 0 can reduce artifacts
